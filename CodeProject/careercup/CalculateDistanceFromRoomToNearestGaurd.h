/*
Given a 2-D matrix represents the room, obstacle and guard like the following (0 is room, B->obstacle, G-> Guard):
0 0 0
B G G
B 0 0

calculate the steps from a room to nearest Guard and set the matrix, like this
2 1 1
B G G
B 1 1
Write the algorithm, with optimal solution.

Typed it in directly... so expect bugs (or plain incorrectness :P )
BFS initiated from all guard positions and +1 for reaching a naked position (a '0') and add it to queue to keep the BFS search going.
